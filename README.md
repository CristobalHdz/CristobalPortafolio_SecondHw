The header scrolls with the window and stays on the top section.

## About Me
This section was particularly complicated. At start, I finished it but when I resized it it was complete chaos and I decided to continue with the other sections. When I came back to the section I remaked it on its entirety and applied flexboxes.

## Contact Me
This was a plain contact form, taken form w3schools, and applied to my porfolio. I could not come with a better way to format it so I just gave it some tweaks.
